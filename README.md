# YY-CHR Files

Settings and customizations for YY-CHR (for the `yychr20190719` release).

These are meant to make graphics editing and viewing easier with this version of YY-CHR, for particular workflows (eg. GB development).

There is a mirror included in this repo under `mirror/` for the exact version (`yychr20190719`) that this configuration is made for. These files are copyright the YY-CHR author, and only mirrored here for archival/convenience.
